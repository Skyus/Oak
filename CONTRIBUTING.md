# Contribution Guidelines

I'd love it if you contribute! There are just two key guidelines for contributing (the last of which is legally binding):

* Please follow the conventions in "Documentation/Conventions.md".
* By submitting a pull request, you represent that you: 1. Have the right to license your contribution to the general public. 2. Agree that your contributions are irrevocably licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 as published by the Mozilla Foundation, including compatibility with secondary licenses. A verbatim copy is included in the root directory of the repository for your convenience.
